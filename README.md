## Requirements

Make sure you are using MongoDB version 1.3 or newer. `delayed_job_mongoid`
uses the `findandmodify` command which is only available in recent versions.

## Installation

Add the gem to your Gemfile:

    gem 'delayed_job_mongoid'

After running `bundle install`, create the indexes (and don't forget to do this
on your production database):

    script/rails runner 'Delayed::Backend::Mongoid::Job.create_indexes'

To generate script/delayed_job:

    rails generate delayed_job

That's it. Use [delayed_job](http://github.com/collectiveidea/delayed_job) as
normal.
